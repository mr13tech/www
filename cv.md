Fullstack engineer with 7+ years building at the intersection of blockchain, big data, and distributed systems. Built the first Ethereum internal transaction indexer in the AML/compliance industry (2017) — a C++ solution that processed 4M blocks in 6 hours on 256MB RAM. Comfortable across the full stack from low-level protocol work to React frontends. Strong focus on architecture, performance optimization, and test automation. Enjoy mentoring engineers and making technical decisions, but prefer staying close to the code rather than pure management.

## Skills

**Languages:** Solidity, TypeScript, C++, Java, Python, Golang

**Blockchain:** EVM internals, Hardhat, Foundry, Viem, Ethers.js, IPFS/Filecoin, ERC standards, Circom (ZK circuits), data indexing

**Data:** Apache Spark, MapR, Hadoop, Neo4j, SQL, NoSQL, ETL pipelines

**Infrastructure:** GCP, Docker, CI/CD, Linux, node operations

**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, Figma

** AI **: AI coding feels productive.
Focused.
Almost meditative.

You prompt. It responds.
Sometimes you get magic.
Sometimes… you get something that almost works.

And that’s the trap.

The loop is addictive:
“One more prompt.”
“One more tweak.”
“One more try and this bug is gone.”

But real engineering isn’t about rolling the dice until it compiles.
It’s about understanding, ownership, and knowing why something works, not just that it does.

AI can accelerate builders.
It can also quietly replace thinking if we let it.

The future isn’t “AI vs engineers.”
It’s engineers who stay intentional and those who don’t.

Use the tool.
Don’t become dependent on the spin.
