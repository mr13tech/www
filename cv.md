Family, peers, freedom.
In 2017ish I was amazed by ethere
um, since then it had been focus. Nowadays I am open for next steps in new
realms but biggest preference is to combine web3, big data and AI and cooperation;
Main experience of mine is chain data ETL, smart contracts development and tech lead. I got two places: coinfirm
and copernicspace
. Both in startup up environment, with a lot of responsibilites, proactive initiatives and tons
of fun! And on the side I was participating in hackathons by ethglobal and some others. Also been consulting to
bootstrap other startups
