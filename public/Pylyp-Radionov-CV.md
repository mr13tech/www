# PROFILE

  

Fullstack engineer with 7+ years building at the intersection of blockchain, big data, and distributed systems. Built the first Ethereum internal transaction indexer in the AML/compliance industry (2017) — a C++ solution that processed 4M blocks in 6 hours on 256MB RAM.

  

Currently focused on **AI-augmented engineering**, utilizing Spec-Driven Development to accelerate architecture and delivery. Comfortable across the full stack, from low-level protocol work and ZK circuits to high-conversion React frontends. I enjoy mentoring engineers and owning product outcomes, blending technical execution with strategic decision-making.
